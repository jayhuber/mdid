INSTALLATION

Requirements:

1) 	Moodle 2.2.x, 2.3.x
	The plug-in might work with previous versions of 2, but has only been tested with this version.

2)	Iframe and Javascript are used to access the MDID slideshow.  The system automagically logs in the student account and displays the MDID2 URL inside a Frame. 


How to install:

1)  Copy the "mdid" folder into the following folder: moodle/mod/. 
2)  Load the "Notifications" page on the Moodle home page - this will create database tables used by the activity and you will have an opportunity to configure the student account to access to the MDID activity.



Changing the student access account:
1)  As admin navigate to Site Administration -> Plugins -> Activity modules -> MDID
